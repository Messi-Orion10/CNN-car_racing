\section{Introduction}
In this homework, we are invited to solve an image classification problem to learn the behavior of a racing car in a Gym environment. For image classification problem we mean to analyze the image and identify the class (label) to which it belongs. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications. Gym, launched by OpenAI, is an open-source bank of artificial intelligence projects. This database has been put together for developers to use various artificial intelligence techniques such as reinforcement learning and computer vision to solve these environments. The environment explored in this study was CarRacing-v0, a 2D autonomous vehicle environment. Using machine learning an agent was trained to learn this track.
